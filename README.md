### Project Description
It has smart led lighting system using LDR to reduce power consumption(i.e,automatic gate light),stair case led using IR sensor and also has a gas sensor to sense the leakage of LPG gas in home for safety.PIR sensor in bed room to switch on the led when any montion is detected,servo motor for automatic door smart parking area using ultrasonic sensor and buzzer.

### The Problem statement
this project invovles home automation for energy efficiency,security,and covenience by intergating smart lighting

### The Solution
This project literally makes as lazy,so bascially we used LDR for automatic outdoor post light which power on during night or when it gets dark around.ultrosonic sensor with buzzer to ensure a safe parking og cars in parking area.IR sensor and servo motor combo to automate the door opening and closing when a person approches the door.Another IR sensor is used near the stair case to automatically switch on  the leds sequentially when some one approches the steps.A PIR sensor is used in the bedroom for effect powering of lights when a person is in motion or can know if someone gets into our room without our knowledge at night when we are sleeping.A gas sensor is fixed in the kitchen area to improve safety  i.e, it detects and alarms the person in the home if any gas leakage is noticed.
